# I've joined the #30DaysOfReact Challenge

`30 days of react`: is a challenge that aims at learning react by allocating at least 1h every day, to learn and practice react, for the next 30 days.
\
The purpose/utility of this challenge is stop dreaming of sit down and start coding or setting some good intentions on dedicating one hour each night for coding.
\
Rather, by committing to this challenge, and because it's a public commitment as we all are going to follow your updates , you'll be able to stick to this new habit.
\
**So letâ€™s do this together!**
